##Class description

This is a studio based course that introduces students to the theory and practice of New Media Arts. Students will learn fundamental practices of electronic arts and interaction design including but not limited to circuit design, basic to intermediate electronics, and programming for interactivity. Through hands on exercises, students will explore basic electronic techniques and use of programmable microcontrollers (Arduino) to control interactive art, sound, light, and environments. Students will also be introduced to various professional new media artists and their work through survey lectures rooted in the history, theory, and current practices of responsive and new media art.

There are no prerequisites for this course.

Although not required, students should anticipate spending some money to purchase materials for use in constructing class projects (typically under $100, depending on the type of project).

##Class goals

Students will learn how:

* to develop basic skills in reading, interpreting, and critiquing art, with a focus on new media art.
* to apply experimentation and research to artmaking
* to make art for an audience and participate in critiques.
* to apply basic techniques from the fields of electronics and programming to artmaking
* to make art that critically engages relevant art history and contemporary technological, political, economic, cultural, and artistic contexts


##Class Structure

At the beginning of the semester, students will choose and present a social practice that they'd like to investigate. 

There are four main topic areas that this class will cover: Social Media, Sound, 3D Manufacturing, and Wearables / Robotics. The Social Media section will introduce students to programming. 

The class will consist of a series of short lectures, class discussions, field trips, and workshops that explore technical, art-historical, and theoretical topics that are vital to understanding contemporary new media art and its potential future directions.

Students will read key texts, discuss, build things, and look at a lot of art. 

Some in-class work time for assigned projects will be provided, but it is expected that students spend the majority of project work time outside of class.

##Reading Materials / References

Assigned readings will focus on primary texts written by influential artists, curators, and theorists. There is no required textbook for this class, and all assigned reading materials will be provided to students via the internet.

###Conferences and Festivals
* Ars Electronica: <http://aec.at> 
* Transmediale: <http://transmediale.de> 
* Dutch Electronic Arts Festival: <http://deaf.nl>
* International Symposium on Electronic Art: <http://isea-web.org>
* Zero1: <http://zero1.org/>

##Assigned projects
Students will complete four experiments, one for each topic area. In-class work time will be provided for each.

At the end of the class, students will complete a final project, which can be an extension and refinement of a previous project, or something entirely new. This project will be developed in consultation with the instructor.


####Documentation
Students must document the final project using photography and/or video, as well as any other applicable technique. Project documentation must be posted to the class blog before class begins. Documentation will count as part of the project grade.


##Evaluation

Class projects are opportunities to explore new ideas and techniques. Unfortunately, grades can discourage students from taking risks in artmaking. To counter this, project evaluations in this class will prioritize inventiveness, energy, curiosity, ambition, criticality, and creative risk-taking over engineering skill. A technically sound project that doesn't experiment beyond tried-and-true approaches may receive a C, while a partially failed but exceptionally creative effort may receive an A.


##Grading

* Participation in discussion, workshops, and critiques: 30%
* Experiments: 40% (10% each)
* Final Project: 30% (due 4/27/2016)

Extra credit may be given (at the instructor's discretion) for work that demonstrates exceptional effort or engagement with the assigned project.


##Class Participation Guidelines
* Come to class prepared to discuss the day's assigned reading, and share any relevant references.

* Actively participate in class discussions and critiques: be generous with attention, and work to generate constructive discussions. 

* Work to make sure that critiques and discussions are helpful, inclusive spaces where everyone's voice can be heard. 

* Contribute to the class blog: <http://introToNMA.wordpress.com>

##Attendance

Attendance is mandatory. Students who miss a class (for any reason) will be responsible for learning the material covered.

Students are requested to be considerate of fellow classmates and arrive in the classroom before 9AM. Each two unexcused tardinesses will count as one unexcused absence. Leaving class early will count as an unexcused tardiness. 

A student's first unexcused absence will not count against their grade, but further unexcused absences will, as follows:

* 2 unexcused absences: -5%
* 3 unexcused absences: -10%

Students who have four or more unexcused absences will fail the class.

###Critique absences
Critiques are an indispensable part of assigned class projects. Students who miss a critique day or do not present work will have one week to turn in the project for half credit. Assignments turned in later than one week past the deadline will not be accepted. No critiques will be rescheduled for unexcused absences or incomplete work.

Students who are ill, or have another acceptable reason (from the list below) to miss class on a critique day, must contact the instructor **before** the missed class for their absence to be considered excused. The instructor will attempt to make an accommodation and schedule a new critique to make up for the one missed, but this may not be possible in all cases.

###Excused absences
Absences will be considered excused if **(a)** the student is ill and notifies the instructor in advance of the absence, or **(b)** the student provides the instructor with a University absence letter as detailed in section [§ 1‑501(c)](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part5_1-501.html) of the student code. Acceptable reasons for absence include: illness, family emergency, religious holidays, and formal participation in scheduled activities of University groups.

##Safety
While risk-taking in most cases is encouraged, students must never risk the safety or well-being of themselves or others. Any potentially dangerous project or action (especially those involving 110VAC wall power wiring in any way) must be cleared with the instructor first, to ensure that all necessary safety precautions are taken.


##Lab Policies

* There is a required laboratory fee for this course ($125) which is used for course materials and supplies that you can keep.
* Eating or drinking must be kept clear of the work spaces.
* Never eat or drink while soldering!
* Clean up after yourself! This includes empty drinks, all small pieces of plastic, and misc. clippings.


##Lab Hours

Lab hours will be posted on the New Media Lab front door.

##Sharing Documentation of Work

Projects created in this course may be used by the Department for purposes of promotion for students, the Department, or the University in general. The Department may also use these materials for instructional purposes in future courses. The instructor may also use documentation of student projects as examples of work completed in the class.

##Changes

This syllabus is provisional. Topics, dates, and schedules may change depending on the needs and interests of the class. Project due dates, required readings, and graded assignment descriptions will not be changed without notification in class or via email.

The latest syllabus will always be available on the class Github page:
