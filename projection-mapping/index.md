* Using multiple projectors for a single video

### Software overview:
* [MadMapper](http://www.madmapper.com/) (Suports Syphon, popular, easy to use, non-free)
* [VPT](https://hcgilje.wordpress.com/vpt/) (Free, cross-platform, don't try to use HD videos, it'll grind to a halt)

* [ofxPiMapper](https://github.com/kr15h/ofxPiMapper) (Free, works on Raspberry Pi)
* [Virtual Mapper](https://github.com/baku89/VirtualMapper) (open source, cross platform, Syphon + Spout, annoying text in the corner you can't remove!!! If you're comfortable with openFrameworks you can recompile and fix this)
* [Painting With Light](http://www.bigfug.com/software/painting-with-light/#downloads)
* [Splash](https://github.com/paperManu/splash/wiki) (Free, geared towards mapping of domes)
* [LPMT](http://hv-a.com/lpmt/) (Not free but cheap, cross-platform, works with MostPixelsEver)

#### VideoProjectionTool (VPT):
https://hcgilje.wordpress.com/vpt/

Tip: Mavericks (and later note: to get fullscreen working, you have to go to:  
system preferences- mission control, then disable "displays have separate spaces"

Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=6tPGP0Ga8a8

Size your sketch to match the aspect ratio of the surface you're projecting onto.
